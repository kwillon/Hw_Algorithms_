# Hw_Algorithms_
This repository contains homework assignments for the 2024 course: Algorithms and Big Data in Chemistry and Materials Science.

## Goals of course
The aim of this course is to organize information about handling big data, review algorithms, and familiarize with server operation.

## About dataset description:
 The dataset comprises quantum chemical properties for 134,000 stable small organic molecules primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and fluorine. These molecules are a subset of the GDB-17 chemical universe, consisting of 166 billion organic molecules. Various geometric, energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties were computed for these molecules using quantum chemistry calculations.
 In this study, 20,000 rows from the original dataset were utilized.

## Data Source
You can find more about the data in the read.me file in the data folder. There you can also find descriptions of which .csv files were used in which notebook and links where they can be found.

## Usage
 - **Hometask1.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the first assignment, obtaining my dataset from the general one.
 - **hometask2.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook contains the extraction of descriptors using RDKit and Mordred, as well as feature selection techniques. 
 - **hometask3.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook contains data cleaning from duplicates, data analysis, and data normalization.
 - **hometask4.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook contains methods for dimensionality reduction and obtaining a dataset with fewer descriptors. 
 - **hometask5.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook contains clustering algorithms and visualization.
 - **hometask6.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook contains Ð¸uilding regression models. (Before PCA, there were no NaN values and then NaN values appeared, also resulting regression visualizations and metrics are not satisfactory, I assume that something goes wrong during PCA)
